# User Requirements

## Phase 1
### User Story 
- the user want a song + guitar chord book app. 
- build an android app.
- first page show the list of song title + search bar
- when the user click the title => open song detail + chord 
- in the detail page => show chord + lyrics
- the user want chord transposition feature. the user can transpose the guitar chord lower or upper.

### Guidelines
- if possible use expo library only [dont use native library as much as possible]
- use react native paper for ui library 
- use theme colors only cuz i need to add dark + white theme
- use chordpro => so that the song can be show in multiple format
- dont add backend yet, just static data
